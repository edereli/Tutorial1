        <p class="title">Software Engineering Student</p>
        <p>Hello! My name is Evrim and I am in my second year of Software Engineering at Western University, and hope to pursue a 
		a dual degree with the Ivey Business School. I have great interpersonal skills, am very organized, meticulous and hardworking.</p>
		<p>I have an extensive work experience from tutoring kids at Kumon and working in the retail and customer service department to most recently completing
		an internship at Ontario's largest nuclear generating station, Bruce Power. There I spent four months during May - August 2023 
		creating microlearning and training modules for engineering and company leaders. </p>
        <p>I like to exercise, play volleyball, and travel. One day I would love to work abroad in many different countries and cities!</p>
